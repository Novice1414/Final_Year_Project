# Abstract
 Diabetes, a prevalent metabolic disorder affecting millions worldwide, underscores
 the urgent need for reliable diagnostic tools. This project aims to reevaluate existing
 models using both Machine Learning (ML) and deep learning algorithms, particularly
 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to improve the accuracy of diabetes detection.
 Acknowledging CNNâ€™s previously observed low accuracy in diabetes detection, this
 work addresses the issue by implementing a hybrid CNN and Deep Neural Network
 (DNN) approach.
 Central to this research is the utilization of the well-established PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset, renowned in diabetes research. This dataset comprises diverse clinical
 attributes such as glucose levels, insulin, BMI, and age, providing a robust foundation
 for model training and testing. Moreover, an updated dataset is curated, incorporating
 additional attributes like obesity, smoking, and high cholesterol. Preprocessing techniques are applied to ensure data quality and relevance.
 The project integrates a DNN architecture to extract intricate spatial dependencies
 within the data. By fine-tuning hyperparameters, the aim is to develop a model that surpasses the limitations of traditional ML algorithms and CNNs, offering a more nuanced
 understanding of diabetes markers.
 Hyperparameter tuning techniques, including early stopping, L1/L2 regularization,
 data augmentation, noise addition, and dropout, are employed to enhance the performance and generalisation ability of the Artificial Neural Network model. Early stopping prevents overfitting by terminating training at an optimal epoch, while L1/L2 regularization mitigates overfitting risks by penalizing large weight values. Additionally, data
 augmentation, noise addition, and dropout contribute to improved model robustness, enabling the effective handling of diverse and challenging datasets.
 Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are utilized to
 comprehensively assess diagnostic performance. The proposed methodology aims not
 only to enhance diabetes detection accuracy but also to provide insights into critical
 features contributing to predictions. The integration of DNNs represents a novel approach to diabetes prediction, highlighting the importance of leveraging deep learning
 architectures for complex data patterns.
 This project contributes to the ongoing discourse on AI applications in healthcare,
 particularly in chronic disease diagnosis. Furthermore, the findings hold promise for
advancing diabetes detection, offering a more accurate and reliable tool for early diagnosis and intervention.
